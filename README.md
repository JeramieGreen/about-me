### Reflections and Comments

- I find that the repitition is key; for getting things committed to memory. One other thing I found was that if I am running into an issue, it is usually something simple that is easily overlooked. A new set of eyes can save a lot of time in those cases.

- Early on in this process I found that my curve for getting back into the workflow of codefellows and development was a little steaper than I had expected. Working with some of the other students has brought down that curve in an amazing way.

- Luis S was the driver while I was the navigator. We wrapped the logic of the questions into functions, and ACP'd after every question.

- Today I am updating my lab-03. I finished my questions. I found them to be easier than I thought they would be to finish.
